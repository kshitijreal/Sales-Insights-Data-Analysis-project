# Sales Insights Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales data to generate insightful visualizations using Power BI. The data preprocessing is carried out using SQL, and the final visualizations are created in Power BI to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

## Dataset
The sales dataset used in this project contains information about transactions, including:
- Date of Sale
- Product ID
- Product Name
- Quantity Sold
- Sales Amount
- Customer ID
- Region

## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: Used for data preprocessing, cleaning, and transformation.
- **Power BI**: Used for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies.
2. **Data Transformation**: Aggregating data, creating new calculated columns, filtering relevant records.
3. **SQL Queries**: Various SQL queries are used to preprocess the data before importing it into Power BI.

## Visualizations
The visualizations created in Power BI include:
- **Sales Trend Analysis**: Line charts showing sales trends over time.
- **Regional Sales Performance**: Bar charts comparing sales across different regions.
- **Product Performance**: Pie charts and bar charts showing top-performing products.
- **Customer Insights**: Demographic and sales behavior analysis of customers.
